# Usage

The script above creates a CSV file (to be imported into Google My Maps or ArcGIS) containing a 36 point grid spaced out by 500m from the Latitude, Longitude coordinates of a centerpoint. The center point can be found through google maps or other GIS services.

## Example Run:
(Quick Example using Google Maps and Google My Maps)  

Go onto Google Maps, and click on your desired centerpoint.

Then get the coordinates of the centerpoint.

Now, run the script with the latitude and longitudes of this center point. The program will generate a CSV called "AOI_Points.csv".  


With the CSV file, we can import it into Google MyMaps.

Select these settings to help my maps setup:

From here, you can move around any points that might be unaccessible (e.g ontop of a house, lake, etc.) and then you can generate directions to collect your points.
